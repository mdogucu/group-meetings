## Why this paper

-   A lot of work on introductory statistics

-   What about statistical theory?

    -   How do we *better* teach topics like MLE, Law of Large Numbers, Consistency?

. . .

-   Further motivation: In 7 months, I may be teaching Mathematical Statistics

## Do we all agree?

From Introduction:

> Probability and mathematical statistics classes are often described by the students enrolled as being dry and irrelevant.

. . .

Why do *you* think so?

## What is student-centered instruction?

> I considered student-centered instruction in order to have students play an active role in their instruction.

## What is it in this paper?

> The second semester class met Tuesday and Thursday for 75 minutes each day. **Tuesday was teacher-centered with lecture notes written on the chalkboard.** I covered all the assigned sections for the week in this one class. This meant that I made sure to give clear explanations of the concepts and how they should be used but had less time for worked examples. **At the end of Tuesdayâ€™s class, I randomly assigned one problem to each of the students to present in class on Thursday.** I made sure that at least one of the chosen in-class problems addressed each of the concepts presented Tuesday and that the in-class problems were standard rather than unusual applications of a concept.

## When does it *not* work?

-   Size of the class

-   How comfortable students are with each other

-   How homogeneous is the class' level

-   Outcome highly depends on the specific group of students

-   May want to score participation

## Advantages

-   Similar benefits as oral exam, but less stress (?)

    -   Oral communication is all the more important these days, as students are especially lacking on this

-   Constant feedback on students' understanding

-   Student learn better from each other than from the teacher(\*)

    -   Teacher instruction needs to be complemented by students learning from each other

## What would we want to assess about this method?

-   Does it help students catch up faster than they otherwise would

-   Does it help students learn incoming topics better (they are constantly building solid foundations)?

-   Oral skills. Would students be able

## Other thoughts

-   Hint policy is good (at exam)

    -   but careful with implementation (avoid walk of shame)
